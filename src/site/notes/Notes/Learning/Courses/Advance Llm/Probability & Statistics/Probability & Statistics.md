##  What is Probability?
**Probability** is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood or chance of different outcomes occurring in a random event. It quantifies uncertainty and measures how likely it is for a specific event to happen.

The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where:
- **0** indicates an impossible event.
- **1** indicates a certain event.
- A probability closer to 0 means the event is less likely to occur, while a probability closer to 1 means it is more likely to occur.

### Key Concepts in Probability:

1. **Experiment**: A process or action that produces a set of results. For example, rolling a die or flipping a coin.
   
2. **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment. For example, getting a 3 when rolling a die.
   
3. **Event**: A set of one or more outcomes. For example, getting an odd number when rolling a die (which includes the outcomes 1, 3, and 5).

4. **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For a die, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

5. **Probability of an Event (P(E))**: The ratio of the number of favourable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space. Mathematically, it's expressed as:
  $$
   
   P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes in the sample space}}
$$

### Types of Probability:

1. **Theoretical Probability**: Based on the reasoning behind probability. It is calculated by analyzing the possible outcomes of an experiment without actually performing the experiment. 

2. **Experimental Probability**: Based on actual experiments or trials. It is calculated by conducting an experiment and recording the outcomes.

3. **Subjective Probability**: Based on personal judgement, experience, or intuition rather than on systematic calculation or experimentation.

### Example:

If you toss a fair coin, there are two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). The probability of getting heads is:
$$\
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{1}{2}
\
$$
since there is one favourable outcome (getting heads) and two possible outcomes (heads or tails).
